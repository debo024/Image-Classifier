The project is an Image classifier based on Neural Net imported from pytorch library and operation is done on MNIST data files.

Dependencies:
1.  torch
2.  matplotlib
3.  MNIST_data
4.  helpers (helpers.py): given download link and given 'helpers.py' is a custom script modified and generated by Udacity.

Download link for helper.py is "https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/blob/master/intro-to-pytorch/helper.py"

'MNIST_data' folder will get download when script will run as it has been included in the script.
